# SP Football Life 2026 on SteamOS ARM (Konkr Pocket Fit and similar)

Run a **copy of SP Football Life 2026 you already have** (SmokePatch, `FL_2026.exe`) on an ARM handheld running SteamOS,
without Lutris. Tested on the Konkr Pocket Fit Gen3 (Snapdragon SM8650, Adreno 750): menus, matches, Sider mods and the
built-in controller all work in **Game Mode**.

The game itself is **not included**. You need your own working game folder (the one with `FL_2026.exe`, `SiderAddons/`, `Data/`).

## Quick start

1. Copy your game folder to the device, e.g. `/home/steamos/Games/SP Football Life 2026/`.
2. Copy this whole folder (it must keep `install-spfl26.sh`, `spfl26-settings.sh` and `artwork/` together) to the device.
3. Switch to **Desktop Mode**, open Konsole in that folder and run:
   ```
   chmod +x install-spfl26.sh
   ./install-spfl26.sh "/home/steamos/Games/SP Football Life 2026"
   ```
   (If the game is in the default `~/Games/SP Football Life 2026`, no argument is needed.)
4. When it asks, let it close Steam (needed to add the Game Mode shortcuts).
5. Switch to Game Mode and start **SP Football Life 2026** from *Library > Non-Steam*, or double-click the Desktop icon.

You also get a second shortcut, **SP Football Life 2026 - Settings**, to change resolution, V-Sync and so on
(see "Changing settings" below).

The script is safe to run again. It needs internet once (about 450 MB download) and about 3 GB of free space.

## Requirements

- A SteamOS ARM image with **Box64** and x86 support already set up. Tested on **SteamOS for ARM v1.3** from
  [hashtagbasit/SteamOS-ARM-Port](https://github.com/hashtagbasit/SteamOS-ARM-Port/) on a Konkr Pocket Fit. Other builds may work if they provide Box64.
  Check with `box64 --version` and `cat /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/box64`.
- `curl` and `python3` (normally already installed).

## Changing settings (resolution, full screen, V-Sync, controller)

Open the **SP Football Life 2026 - Settings** shortcut (Steam, Game Mode or Desktop icon), or run `~/Games/spfl26-settings.sh`.
Close the game first, pick your values and press **OK**. It then asks **"Launch the game now?"**: choose **Launch game** to
play straight away, or **Close**. It works from Game Mode, so you never need to go back to Desktop Mode.

(This is a small replacement for the game's own `Settings.exe`, which needs .NET and crashes on ARM.)

## Tips

- **Use Game Mode to play.** In Desktop Mode some controller buttons don't work during matches.
- **Quit from the game's own menu.** Do not close the small black window or "Sider" from the taskbar: that can leave
  the game unable to start (see Troubleshooting).
- **Sider** is the mod loader behind the SmokePatch extras (stadiums, kits, anthems...). It starts by itself, you don't have to do
  anything. Its optional on-screen menu opens with the **Space** key (a keyboard is needed).
- **Low fps (about 40-50)?** The game is limited by the CPU (x86 emulation), not the GPU, so lowering the resolution or graphics
  barely helps. What helped most for smoothness on the Konkr is a fixed frame rate that fits the screen: set the refresh rate to
  **90 Hz** in the quick access menu and add the line `export DXVK_FRAME_RATE=45` to `~/Games/launch-spfl26.sh`
  (before the last line, `exec ...`). Locked 45 fps looks smoother than a rate that jumps between 40 and 50.
  Not added by default, because faster devices may not need it.
- **Frame generation (Lossless Scaling / lsfg-vk via Decky):** it loads into the game (the launcher passes Steam's app ID on, so per-game
  profiles match), but in my tests on the Konkr it did **not** help: the game dropped to about 30 fps, 2x only reached a steady 60 with visible
  artifacts on the ball, and 3x/4x was worse. Your device or settings may give better results, so it is worth a try, but don't expect miracles.
- **Don't tweak Box64 speed options** such as `BOX64_DYNAREC_BIGBLOCK=3` or `BOX64_DYNAREC_SAFEFLAGS=0`: they make the match never finish loading.
- Leave the Steam overlay **off** for these shortcuts (the script already does this).
- Gameplay "Switcher": the Windows `FL26 switcher.exe` needs .NET and wasn't tested on ARM. eskay993's repo has a bash version
  (`FL_2026_Switcher-Linux.zip`, needs `yad`): https://github.com/eskay993/gamefiles/tree/main/sp-football-life-2026

## Troubleshooting

- **The game hangs on a black window saying "Launching sider... sider active... Launching FL..." (or on a small grey window in
  Game Mode), one CPU core at 100%.** Usually caused by closing the game or Sider from the taskbar instead of quitting normally.
  Box64 keeps a code cache for the game and a broken one makes the next launch spin forever. Fix, in Desktop Mode (Konsole):
  1. Stop everything left over: `WINEPREFIX=~/Games/SPFL26-prefix/pfx ~/x86ge/GE-Proton9-27/files/bin/wineserver -k`
  2. Move the game's cache files away (they are rebuilt on the next launch, so the first start is a bit slower):
     ```
     mkdir -p ~/box64-cache-aside
     mv ~/.cache/box64/fl_2026.exe-* ~/.cache/box64/sider.* ~/.cache/box64/ddraw.dll-* ~/box64-cache-aside/
     ```
  3. Start the game again.
- **Game never opens, one CPU core at 100%, and you didn't close anything:** wrong Proton version (see the table below) or
  the `PROTON_NO_*SYNC` variables are missing from `~/Games/launch-spfl26.sh`.
- **Black screen with sound in Game Mode:** make sure `ENABLE_GAMESCOPE_WSI=0` is in `~/Games/launch-spfl26.sh`.
- **Start from scratch:** delete `~/Games/SPFL26-prefix` and run the script again. This also deletes your saves, so back up
  `~/Games/SPFL26-prefix/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/KONAMI/` first.
- **Updating the game (SmokePatch `SPFL26_XXX.exe` updates):** install the update on a Windows PC, copy the changed files over the
  game folder on the device, then run the script again (safe).
- Keep a backup copy of the game folder somewhere safe: the script does not install the game itself.

## How it works (for doing it by hand, or if you are curious)

The script does this:

1. Downloads **GE-Proton9-27 (x86_64 build)** from the GloriousEggroll releases, checks its SHA-512 and extracts it to `~/x86ge/`.
2. In the game folder: copies `xinput1_3.dll` to `ddraw.dll` (this is how Sider hooks in, same as the Lutris script
   does) and writes `FL_2026.bat` (starts `SiderAddons\sider.exe`, waits for its log, then starts `FL_2026.exe`).
3. Writes `~/Games/launch-spfl26.sh`, which runs `proton run FL_2026.bat` with:
   - `WINEDLLOVERRIDES="ddraw=n,b;steam_api64=n,b;lsteamclient=d"`
   - `PROTON_NO_ESYNC=1 PROTON_NO_FSYNC=1 PROTON_NO_NTSYNC=1` (needed: Wine under Box64 deadlocks on ntsync)
   - `PROTON_USE_XALIA=0`, `ENABLE_GAMESCOPE_WSI=0`
   - the Wine prefix in `~/Games/SPFL26-prefix`
4. Creates that prefix and installs a default `settings.dat` (XInput, Full Screen, V-Sync Enable 2, 1920x1080) into
   `…/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/KONAMI/eFootball PES 2021 SEASON UPDATE/`.
5. Installs the settings tool `~/Games/spfl26-settings.sh`.
6. Creates two Desktop icons and two non-Steam shortcuts (overlay off): **SP Football Life 2026** and
   **SP Football Life 2026 - Settings**. It installs the Steam library artwork from `artwork/` (game) and `artwork/settings/`
   (Settings) under each shortcut's ID. Existing images are never overwritten, so you can replace them later with the
   Decky SteamGridDB plugin.

### Why GE-Proton 9 + Box64 (don't "upgrade")

All of these were tried and **fail** for this game on the Konkr:

| Attempt | Result |
|---|---|
| Valve Proton 11 / Experimental (ARM64, FEX) | `FL_2026.exe` hits an invalid instruction (`0F 3E`) in its protector, FEX loops on the exception and the game never opens |
| Proton-CachyOS and GE-Proton 11 ARM64 (FEX) | same crash |
| GE-Proton 11 x86_64 via Box64 | spins forever at 100% on one thread, never opens a window |
| **GE-Proton 9-27 x86_64 via Box64** | **works** |

The SPFL community also reports that Wine/GE-Proton newer than Wine 10.16 / GE-Proton 10 break the Steam API
hooks this game relies on, so stay on 9.x.
